codeigniter for Debian
----------------------

The upstream recommendation for utilizing multiple application on a signle codeigniter
installation is to place them in sub directories under application, and create individual
index.php files for each of them; This approach would result in that any codeigniter
application would be enabled per default on install.

Instead the installation is rather static, and packages in need to codeigniter should place it's own
appllication in an system/application directory, and then use dh_codeignitor on that directory,
which will create all required symlinks to codeignitor.
